// This exists because of a support report that took four escalating remedies
// and still failed. The user uninstalled, deleted the leftovers, wiped the
// folder, and reinstalled to the default path, and the 503 survived all of it —
// because the thing causing it was a URL reservation in the kernel and a
// config file in %USERPROFILE%\.config, and no uninstaller touched either.
// Every remedy he tried was a guess, because nothing on the machine would tell
// him where to look.
//
// So this is a read-only report, and it goes out of its way to name FULL PATHS
// and exact commands. It changes nothing: someone running a diagnostic on a
// broken install must not have to wonder whether the diagnostic broke it
// further.
// reportOffload answers "will this actually use the GPU", which nothing did on
// the Go path. launch.bat raised the engine's log verbosity and grepped for the
// offload line; the pinned build prints nothing about offload at its default
// verbosity and exposes nothing over /props.
//
// The engine can simply be asked. --list-devices enumerates what it will
// offload to, which answers "will it" rather than "could it" -- the backend
// libraries beside it are only the explanation when the answer is none.
