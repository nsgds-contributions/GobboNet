echo   GEMMA 4 -- LAN ACCESS SETUP
echo.
echo   This script configures Windows to let your phone
echo   connect to the chat over your local network.
echo.
echo   Access is limited to devices on your local subnet,
echo   and the chat itself requires a password (set in
echo   GobboNet). The wider internet cannot reach it, and
echo   nobody on your network gets in without the password.
echo.
echo   NOTE: if you re-run this after an earlier version, it
echo   will UPDATE the existing rules to the current scope.
echo.
echo   It must be run ONCE as Administrator.
echo   You do NOT need to run this again after the first
echo   time, even after reboots.

::      gobbonet.exe and this script in the same second, so the file has never
::      existed yet and we always fell through to the default.
::   2. 1.5.5 moved the default from 8080 to 9066, but a config written before
::      that carries 8080 explicitly and config.toml lives in %USERPROFILE%,

::      Windows that header is translated, the match always failed, and
::      the script always took the "add" branch.
::   2. The account name in the add command is LOCALISED -- Jeder, Tout
::      le monde, Todos, Wszyscy -- so the add failed with "no such
::      account".
::   3. >nul swallowed that error and nothing checked errorlevel, so it
::      printed [OK] URL ACL added having added nothing.
::
:: Fixes: match on the URL itself, which is never translated; use the
:: SDDL form, where WD is the well-known Everyone SID S-1-1-0 and is
:: byte-identical on every locale; and VERIFY afterwards.
::
:: This matters more than it looks. "I ran setup-lan.bat and it said OK"

echo   ONE MORE STEP if you ran this script by hand: the
echo   firewall is only half of LAN access. GobboNet must also
echo   be told to listen on the network, or these rules stand
echo   in front of a closed door and your phone times out with
echo   no error anywhere. In a NORMAL command window -- not
echo   this Administrator one, which may write to a different
echo   user's settings -- run:
echo     gobbonet.exe config set listen_host 0.0.0.0
echo   then restart GobboNet. Choosing LAN access in the setup
