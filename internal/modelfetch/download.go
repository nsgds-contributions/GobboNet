// Package modelfetch downloads a catalogue model to disk and reports progress.
//
// This code was the first-run wizard's, and lived in `package setup` until the
// settings panel needed the same job done from the running server. Nothing here
// was rewritten in the move: the checksum policy, the size floor and the error
// strings were arrived at against real HuggingFace failures and are load-bearing
// exactly as they are. The only edits were exporting the identifiers the second
// caller needs, and adding Entry() so a caller can read back what it asked for.
//
// One download at a time is a policy of the *callers*, not of this type — both
// hold a single *Download and consult its state before starting another. The
// type itself is safe for concurrent status reads while Run is in flight.
