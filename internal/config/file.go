# This is the shared configuration file. It is written by the
# installer and by 'gobbonet setup', but can also be edited
# manually. After editing, restart the server to pick up changes.
#
# You can also read and write single values without a TOML
# parser, which is how the launcher scripts use it:
#   gobbonet config get llm_url
#   gobbonet config set llm_url http://192.168.1.100:8080
#
# Everything above the [ui] section at the bottom is for the
# SERVER. The [ui] section presets things in the chat page

# --- Upstream llama.cpp server ------------------------------------------
# Base URL of the llama-server process. This can be:
#   http://127.0.0.1:11437      - local llama.cpp server
#   http://192.168.1.100:8080   - remote machine on your LAN
#                                 (8080 is llama.cpp's own default)
#   https://your-server.com     - remote with TLS
#
# The UI and chat state are served by this program. The llama.cpp
# server handles model inference. They talk over HTTP.
#
# 11437 and not 11434 because 11434 is Ollama's port. Sharing it meant
# the launcher saw Ollama answering, assumed llama-server was already
# up, and never started its own.
llm_url = "http://127.0.0.1:11437"

# --- Optional upstream services -----------------------------------------
# If nothing answers, features degrade gracefully: web search turns off
# and RAG falls back to tag-only retrieval. Leave empty to disable.
#
# search_url is the web-search API this server forwards /search to. It is
# the ONLY upstream that is not on your machine, and it is reached only
# when you turn search on and supply your own key -- which the browser
# sends and this server passes through without storing. Point it at your
# own relay if you would rather it not talk to ollama.com directly, or
# empty it to switch the feature off.

# without one: retrieval falls back to weighted tags and chat is unaffected.
# embed_model defaults to <data_dir>/embeddings/nomic-embed-text-v1.5.Q8_0.gguf.
# embed_exe defaults to server_exe, then to the engine beside this binary --
# set it only in remote mode, where server_exe is empty by definition.
embed_enable = true
# embed_model = ""
# embed_exe = ""

# --- Model catalogue ----------------------------------------------------
# The list of downloadable models shown by "Add a Model" in the config
# panel. Keeping it online means models added after your install show up
# without you reinstalling anything.
#
# This is the second and last thing GobboNet fetches from the internet,
# after web search. What it sends: a plain GET for a static ~5 KB JSON
# file. No query parameters, no cookies, no identifier, no telemetry, and
# in particular NOT your hardware -- the whole list is downloaded and
# filtered on your machine rather than asking a server what fits your GPU.
# The browser is never involved; this binary does the fetching.
#
# The answer is cached for a day, so this is at most one request per day
# and usually fewer. Set model_catalog_remote = false to switch it off
# entirely: nothing is requested, and the list comes from the cache or
# the models.ini that shipped with GobboNet. Downloading a model still
# works either way.

# one, and against the hash HuggingFace records for the file otherwise.
# The first is the stronger check: it does not come from the host serving
# the weights, so the two would have to agree in order to lie. When both
# exist and disagree, the download is refused outright.
#
# Left false because the models.ini that ships here carries no hashes and
# the published catalogue does not yet either, so turning it on refuses
# every stock download. Turn it on when you run a catalogue of your own
# with a sha256 on every entry -- then a missing hash means the catalogue
# is wrong, and you want to hear about it rather than download anyway.

# port every other dev tool also wants, and on Windows the ranges
# Hyper-V, WSL2 and Docker reserve can swallow it -- which shows up as a
# bind failure that netstat cannot explain. If you change this, stay

# --- Local-backend (hot-swap) settings ----------------------------------
# Set server_exe to the llama-server binary to run in LOCAL MODE, where
# this program starts, supervises and hot-swaps llama.cpp for you.
#
# Leave it empty for REMOTE MODE, where llm_url points at a server that
# something else manages. Both modes have full feature parity except
# hot-swap: auth, state sync, generation jobs, web search, RAG, and

# not data, so nothing large is ever written next to this file.
# data_dir = ""

# Directory containing .gguf model files. These appear in the model
# selector dropdown. Scanned on demand, so dropping a new GGUF in here
# makes it show up without a restart.

# --- Access control -----------------------------------------------------

# idle_standdown_minutes

#   freeing its VRAM, and reload it on the next one. 0 keeps it
#   loaded always. Default 5.
#
#   Only does anything when THIS server runs llama.cpp. In remote
#   mode the process belongs to someone else and stopping it is
#   not ours to do.
#
#   The reload costs the same as a cold start, so a short timeout
#   trades waiting for memory. Also in CONFIG in the chat page.

# show_engine_output
#   Mirror llama.cpp's own output into this window as the model
#   loads, so you can watch it happen and see whether your GPU
#   is being used. Default true.

#   Turn it off for a machine where nobody reads the console.
