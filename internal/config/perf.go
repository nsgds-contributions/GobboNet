// Runtime tuning: the three llama-server launch arguments a user is most
// likely to want to change without editing a file.
//
// These are deliberately a SEPARATE layer from config.toml rather than a
// rewrite of it. config.toml carries what the hardware probe decided —
// installer/gobbonet.nsi writes ctx_size and kv_cache_type there from
// hardware.ini, and on Linux and macOS a human writes them by hand. That is the
// AUTO baseline, and it is the thing "put it back how it was" has to restore.
//
// If /perf wrote into config.toml, the first save would destroy it. Reset could
// then only fall back to the compiled-in 16384/99/q8_0, which is exactly wrong
// on the machines that need reset most: a 6GB card probed down to ctx 8192
// would be "reset" up to 16384 and fail to load. So the override lives beside
// the baseline instead, and reset is a file deletion.
//
// The overlay is applied by the serve path only. `gobbonet config get ctx_size`
// still reports what config.toml says, because that is the file `config set`
// writes — a getter and a setter that disagree about which file they mean would
// be worse than either layer alone.
